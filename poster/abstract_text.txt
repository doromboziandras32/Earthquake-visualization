The goal of the project is the development of a dashboard, which supports the exploration of past earthquake events in details. The earthquake events are represented on maps, and the selected events are being queried on the backend in order to extract their details. 
The processing will provide waveform and spectrogram representation of the event, as well as the sonified form of the earthquake event: the waveform will be sonified on the way that the waveform will be audible by human ears, in order to make such event to be perceiveable not just by the eyes on the spectral form, but by the ears on the sonified form as well.
